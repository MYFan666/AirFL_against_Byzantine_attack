This paper integrates orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and SignSGD with majority vote to enhance the resilience of AirFL against Byzantine attacks by performing one-bit quantized gradient compression.

In the document **Supplementary Material for 'One-Bit Aggregation for Over-the-Air Federated Learning Against Byzantine Attacks"**, we present the detailed derivations for Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.
